•	Sample: This step entails choosing a subset of the appropriate volume dataset from a vast dataset that has been given for the model’s construction. The goal of this initial stage of the process is to identify variables or factors (both dependent and independent) influencing the process. The collected information is then sorted into preparation and validation categories.
•	Explore: During this step, univariate and multivariate analysis is conducted in order to study interconnected relationships between data elements and to identify gaps in the data. While the multivariate analysis studies the relationship between variables, the univariate one looks at each factor individually to understand its part in the overall scheme. All of the influencing factors that may influence the study’s outcome are analyzed, with heavy reliance on data visualization.
•	Modify: In this step, lessons learned in the exploration phase from the data collected in the sample phase are derived with the application of business logic. In other words, the data is parsed and cleaned, being then passed onto the modeling stage, and explored if the data requires refinement and transformation.
•	Model: With the variables refined and data cleaned, the modeling step applies a variety of data mining techniques in order to produce a projected model of how this data achieves the final, desired outcome of the process.
•	Assess: In this final SEMMA stage, the model is evaluated for how useful and reliable it is for the studied topic. The data can now be tested and used to estimate the efficacy of its performance.
